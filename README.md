### Speakers
Tonia Blair, Sylvana Santos

### Prerequisites
- Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- Make sure you have a Github account

### Description
In this beginner workshop, two developers from Codecademy, Tonia Blair and Sylvana Santos, will dive into the basics of APIs. To start, we'll answer:
- What is an API?
- How do they work?
- What can we do with them?

We’ll discuss the basics of working with APIs to fetch data from the web. We’ll also take a look at a developer tool called Postman that can be used for easy API testing.
We'll end the session by building a small app that:
- Uses Javascript to fetch data from an open source API
- Sorts through the data
